The HR Navigation Model is a machine learning–based project that supports data-driven HR decision-making through three predictive models — Promotion, Attrition, and Hiring.

Promotion Model: Identifies employees with high promotion potential using performance and experience data.

Attrition Model: Predicts employee turnover risk to improve retention strategies.

Hiring Model: Assesses candidate profiles to enhance hiring efficiency and success rates.

This project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow — including data preprocessing, EDA, model training, evaluation, and visualization — using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

It highlights practical data science skills such as classification modeling, feature engineering, and HR analytics to optimize workforce management decisions.
